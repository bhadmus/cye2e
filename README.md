# cye2e

Are you a newbie in QA Engineering? Are you trying to ease your way into Automation? Have you been learning Cypress? Would you like to be able to set up Cypress with a BDD framework and reporter without stress?

If yes, this plugin is for you. Since I started training people in software automation, the majority of problems that I have had to help people resolve is usually around set up. Hence, the reason that I decided to create this plugin so that people can easily setup cypress.

You can create a cypress Template project that you can easily edit to suit your purpose.

## Installation
`npm install -g cye2e`

## Usage
 - After Installation, open the terminal in your desired directory and run `cye2e`

 ## Example

 Going through the questions looks like this


| ![BDD](shots/cy-e2e-09.jpg)   |
|:--:| 
| *BDD Typsecript Config with reporter selected* |

| ![TDD](shots/cy-e2e-10.jpg) |
|:--:| 
| *Cypress Config with no BDD or reporter selected* |


| ![TDD and Eslint](shots/cy-e2e-17.png) |

| *Cypress Config with no BDD or reporter selected but eslint selected* |

| ![Project-Structure](shots/cy-e2e-11.jpg) |

| ![CI/CD-Structure](shots/cy-e2e-16.jpg) |

| *Cypress Config with BDD, Reporter, and GitHub Template* |

| ![CI/CD-Structure](shots/cy-e2e-15.jpg) |
|:--:| 
| *Cypress BDD Folder Structure with GitHub Template* |

 You can run the `npx cypress run` or `npx cypress open` command to see it execute.

 What's left is to continue to edit the template created to suit your needs
